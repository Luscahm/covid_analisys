# Introduction

Hi\
A while ago I wanted to study dates and predicts, so  considering the current state that we live, I decided to use the covid-19 datasets 
to learn more about this computing area, doing a small data analisys and trying to predict future cases of covid-19. Whereas the
virus don´t depends only on mathematical and statistical progress to spread,but  also depends of the human factor (quarantine
and medicines) and also that I am neither a statistician nor a data scientist,these predictions may not be correct
however it can provide a basis for what lies ahead.\

# Archives
The beta version is the "brute" archive, when it´s the gridsearch, and a practically unreadable code mix.
the tag [PT] represent portuguese version of the code, the [EN] version is on working\
You can navigate into the branchs of that git, to go to the version wanted
